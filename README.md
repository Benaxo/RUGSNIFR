A simple website + Twitter bot that checks the rug probability of any memecoin based on live blockchain data. Uses sarcasm, memes, and raw facts to slap users in the face before they ape.

Owner wallet %

Liquidity lock % + duration

Dev wallet activity (based on heuristics)

Contract renounced: Y/N

Community score (based on volume / holders)

Final verdict:

"TOTAL RUG 💀"

"Mid but Safe-ish 🤷"

"Decent. Go ape. 🚀"

Frontend:

Meme-style UI (Think: Solana shitcoin explorer + dog icons)

Mobile-first

Backend/Stack:

Node.js + Express / Vite + React

Solana/EVM explorer API (like Birdeye + Ethplorer)

Optional: GPT-4 for sarcastic commentary

Extra:

Button to “BUY THIS RUG ANYWAY” (for the degenerates)

Share result as image (for X virality)
